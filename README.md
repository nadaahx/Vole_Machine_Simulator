# Vole_Machine_Simulator
The Vole Machine Simulator is a C++ program that emulates the behavior of a hypothetical computing device known as the "Vole Machine." Following Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, this simulator provides a modular and extensible design for a clear understanding of the Vole Machine's functioning. It allows users to execute Vole Machine instructions, observe the state of the machine, and gain insights into how low-level operations are performed.
